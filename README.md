# Scheduler simulator
This is a Scheduler simulator made in C++ for my final in my Data Structure discipline, where simulate the schedulers FIFO(first in, first out) and SJF(shortest job first) in process scheduling and gives the statistics from both.
# How it works?
All the progam text is in Portuguese, but in summary you must have a text file with a list of numbers with 4 numbers in each row, representing the processes, and tell the progam a number of computers so that way he can calculate the performace of both schedulers.
Here is the project descripition in Portuguese: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fstZab0mQFFzF5th2mCsE6QKqVzGbQCC/view?usp=sharing
# How to run?
